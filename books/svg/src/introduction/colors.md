# Colors

* Some colors have names: black, white, red, green, blue, purple, etc. (See the CSS colors).
* We can express colors as RGB in hexa: `#DE23F1`.
* We can use the single letters: `#A73` which is the same as `#AA7733`.
* We can use decimal numbers `rgb(23, 42, 17)` for the Red, Green, and Blue values.


```
fill="blue"
fill="#DE23F1"
fill="#A73"
fill="rgb(23, 42, 17)"
```
