# Pie chart


I created the SVG file with the rectangle in VS Code and then asked co-pilot to: "add a piechart to the svg file".
It created this example and gave me an explanation of it.

Then I asked it to "Write a python function that will get the segments as parameters and will generate a similar SVG file" and it created a nice one
though it did not use any 3rd party library.

So I asked "is there a 3rd party library that could be used instead of implementing the creation of the chart?"

It suggested Pygal, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
